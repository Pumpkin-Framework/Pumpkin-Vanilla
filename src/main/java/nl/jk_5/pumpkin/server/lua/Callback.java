/**
 * This annotation can be used for methods in an {@link nl.jk_5.pumpkin.server.lua.network.Environment} to mark
 * them for exposure to computers.
 * <p/>
 * Any method exposed like this can be enumerated and called from a computer
 * that can see the node of the environment.
 * <p/>
 * Note that methods annotated with this interface must have the following
 * signature:
 * <pre>
 *     Object[] f(Context context, Arguments arguments) throws Exception;
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The method may return <tt>null</tt> in case it doesn't wish return anything,
 * which is functionally equivalent to returning an empty array.
 * <p/>
 * To raise an error from your callback, simply throw an exception. The
 * convention for Lua is to return (null, "reason") for 'soft' errors, i.e.
 * errors that are no fault of the caller. For example, passing invalid
 * arguments will generate an exception, requesting information and the lookup
 * of said information failing should not.
